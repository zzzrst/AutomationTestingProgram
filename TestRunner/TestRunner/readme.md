##  What is this folder? 

This folder is the runner for the Test Automation Program.

It'll have the ability to create Azure DevOps releases directly from this runner with ui. 

It's for non-technical people to use the application! 

We also have a version using Excel that is currently available to be used as well. 

## Current Functionality

We can currently create automated scripts and execute tests on DevOps without any errors. 

Simply run the GUI and input values for the fields.

The two main functionalities are: 

1. Run on DevOps

- Using API token we can generate tests on AzureDevOps and execute tests there. 
- input fields for Browser, Environment, Build Number, Project, Plan Structure, Notify List, and File Name

2. Run locally
- Run locally and report results locally.
