# TestingDriverBuilder
A Builder class to build a given TestingDriver concrete class. This is still under development. When Instantiating the class, it is given two main parameters, the `TestingDriverType` and parameters. Use the `Build()` function to return the wanted concrete method. This is probably not the best way to get a concreate method due to how some of the methods are implemented.
